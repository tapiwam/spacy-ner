      "After World War II, the few European Jews who had not been killed in the Nazi onslaught began thinking\n",
      "of their future as they were mourning their past. Their loss was unimaginable, but their resilience was\n",
      "unmatchable. They set about finding loved ones, making families, establishing new homes, and rebuilding\n",
      "their lives. They were not called Holocaust survivors at firstthey were displaced persons, immigrants,\n",
      "refugees. In the United States they were busy starting over, and the rest of the country was busy fighting\n",
      "the Cold War. They had lived through one of historys greatest cataclysms, but they were not ready to talk\n",
      "about their experiencesand the world was not yet ready to listen.\n",
      "In the late 1970s that began to change. Their singular ordeal had become known as the Holocaust,\n",
      "and the public was becoming increasingly interested. Somebut not allsurvivors began talking and writing\n",
      "about their experiences. In 1978, President Carter established a commission on the Holocaust that led to\n",
      "the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which opened in 1993. The Museum itself\n",
      "provided a unique venue for survivors to share their experiences and to make a variety of meaningful\n",

      "Now, almost 60 years after the end of World War II, the Museum is celebrating its 10th Anniversary,\n",

      "Holocaust survivors find it difficult to relate what they experienced during the Holocaust. Relatively few\n",
      "have the opportunity to speak and even fewer are comfortable speaking publicly. Still, many feel a sense\n",
      "of duty and obligation to share their experiences and memories. Therefore, it is essential to provide\n",
      "survivors other outlets through which to share their memories.\n",
      "At the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, more than 60 Holocaust survivors volunteer their\n",

      "When I first began working with the Holocaust survivors in the Memory Project, I was unsure what I might\n",
      "be able to contribute. I wondered how it would be possible for me to teach these survivors anything.\n",
      "During our very first meeting I asked our workshop participants what they wanted from me, from\n",
      "a writing workshop, and from each other. Almost without exception, they responded that they wanted to\n",
      "find a clearer voice in which to tell their story. They wanted to gather the tools of the writing craft and\n",
      "produce work that was true to their vision. When I heard this I was relieved, because although these are\n",
      "daunting tasks, they are the goals of all writers. It seemed like familiar ground, a good place to start.\n",
      "From that day on, I have used the premise that the best teachers of writing are writers. I base each\n",
      "class loosely on a piece of writing by a published author of prose or poetry. We have read Holocaust\n",
      "survivors Charlotte Delbo, Ida Fink, and Primo Levi, as well as poet Gerald Stern, novelist Eudora Welty,\n",
      "and others. I began our very first class with an article by novelist and teacher Alice McDermott that\n",
      "begins, I am wary of any advice to writers that smacks of how to. I, too, am wary of this type of advice\n",
      "and use well-written fiction and poetry as a guide rather than coming up with a laundry list of dos and\n",
      "donts for writers. In addition to the works of published writers, workshop participants read and\n",
      "comment on each others work. During most classes, participants are given a sort of prompt and asked to\n",

      "back to the thirteenth century. Her father was a respected attorney and\n",

      "school, which her father had helped found. She loved to play with her sister Beatrice and the other children in the\n",
      "town and enjoyed being with her grandfather. Her childhood was filled with hopes and dreams for the future. In\n",
      "1937, however, members of the fascist Iron Guard tried to remove Erikas father from his position as the chief civil\n",
      "official in Stanesti. Eventually, a court cleared him of the fabricated charges and he was restored to his post.\n",
      "In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Bukovina. A year later, when Romania joined Nazi Germany in the war against\n",
      "the Soviet Union, the Soviets were driven from Stanesti. Mobs then carried out bloody attacks on the towns Jews.\n",
      "During the violence, Erika and her family fled to Czernowitz with the aid of the local police chief. In fall of 1941, the\n",
      "Neumans were forced to settle in the Czernowitz ghetto, where living conditions were poor and they were subject\n",
      "to deportation to Transnistria. In 1943, Erika and Beatrice escaped from the ghetto using false papers that their\n",
      "father had obtained. After escaping to the Soviet Union, Erika and Beatrice returned to Czechoslovakia after World\n",
      "War II, where they were eventually reunited with their parents.\n",
      "Erika married an officer in the Czech army and raised two children. After many years of hard effort and her mother\n",
      "and sisters appeals to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, she was permitted to emigrate from Czechoslovakia to\n",
      "the United States in 1960, three years after the death of her husband. Once in the United States, Erika became a\n",
      "supervisor of a pathology lab.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day in 1941, four men came to our house. They took my family and me to the outskirts of the town,\n",
      "where all the Jews from the town where gathered. We were about 500 Jews. The saddest part was that a lot\n",
      "of the killers were our neighbors. Up to that time, we had a very good life. The first ones that they shot\n",
      "were the Rabbi and his two sons. They continued to shoot only men. People were crying and praying. I\n",

      "They expected me to talk about the Holocaust, not a movie. I asked the children to tell me the moral of\n",

      "Time passed and still no people appeared on the streets. It was so quiet. Like any good tourists we\n",
      "didnt want to waste time, so we drove around the minuscule town taking pictures of sites my sisters had\n",
      "described to me. We easily found the bridge, the waterfall, the park, and then the house where my family\n",
      "had lived. I tried to remember the various stories I had heard about these places. I could imagine Edith,\n",
      "my second-oldest sister, playing on the bridge and dropping the challah dough into the water. This was\n",
      "the dough she was supposed to take to the community oven. The waterfall in the park was just as Ruth,\n",
      "my third sister, had described it. It seemed like a great place to play. The house was exactly where it was\n",
      "supposed to be, though it looked as though it had been through a renovation. It reminded me of the\n",
      "houses in Stratford-on-Avon with its wood beams in the white stucco front.\n",
      "Since we still had seen no people, we drove to Sennfeld looking for the Jewish cemetery that was\n",
      "supposed to be along the way. We didnt find it after driving the short distance between Adelsheim and\n",
      "Sennfeld twice, so we continued to Korb, where Bertl had been born. Again a small, small place in which\n",
      "it was easy to find the house described by my sister. Every place seemed so small and distant from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found it difficult to think that my familys life so many years ago had been contained in this area. I\n",
      "thought of the stories my sisters told of their childhood in this area, but as I looked around me I couldnt\n",
      "picture living here.\n",
      "Eventually we drove back to Adelsheim and found the town stirring. The lunch break was over. It was\n",
      "time to locate the mayor and the town hall. It was almost as if this place continued to conspire against me.\n",
      "We found no one who spoke English. When we finally found the Rathaus it had been closed and relocated.\n",
      "Using a series of pantomimes to ask questions, we found the new town hall. Inside, the clerk introduced\n",
      "us to the deputy mayor, who spoke no English. He in turn found a young man who spoke a few words of\n",
      "English. Eventually they found the letter we had sent and told us that tomorrow an English-speaking\n",
      "person and a man who could tell us about my family would show us around. We agreed to meet at ten the\n",
      "next morning. In the meantime we asked about a place to stay for the night. The clerk tried to persuade\n",
      "us to go to Sennfeld, but I wanted to stay in Adelsheim. This time I would not be sent away. A room was\n",
      "arranged for us at the Gasthaus on the main street.\n",
      "The deputy mayor walked us over to the Gasthaus and introduced us to the owners, who spoke no\n",
      "English. After we had settled into our room, we went downstairs to eat. We had some difficulty with the\n",
      "menu and were not quite sure what we ate. At a nearby table a group of older people kept giving us knowing\n",
      "looks. I wondered if they knew who we were and remembered my parents. I wished I had understood their\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "During the night I had a terrible dream. I thought Nazis were coming up the stairs to find me. I\n",
      "awoke very upset and was glad when daylight appeared.\n",
      "The next morning we met with our guides. Our guides included Mr. Wetterhahn, the deputy mayor,\n",
      "and the wife of the deputy mayor. The wife spoke English and acted as the translator. They showed us the\n",
      "house our family had owned, the place where my father and uncle played cards, where the synagogue had\n",
      "\n",
      "been, and pointed out other sites of interest. Mr. Wetterhahn had known my father and the family so\n",
      "he could tell us how the places related to my family. Our guides showed us various sites in Adelsheim,\n",
      "including a lovely museum with information on the history of the area for several hundreds of years.\n",
      "This museum was usually opened once a week, but they opened it especially for us to see the exhibits.\n",
      "Along with all the sightseeing, we had long conversations with the deputy mayors wife. In her family, as\n",
      "in mine, the subject of the war years and the Holocaust were not discussed. She also felt very strongly that\n",
      "the children needed to learn about this era in their studies. I was a little surprised by the strength of her\n",

      "We all drove to the Jewish cemetery, which was tucked away from the road between Adelsheim and\n",
      "Sennfeld. No wonder we couldnt find it by ourselves! Inside the cemetery, which was kept in good repair,\n",
      "we found tombstones of many family memberssome I had heard of and some I had not. Unfortunately,\n",
      "the writing was in Hebrew so I had difficulty reading it. Even the cemetery was different from the ceme-\n",

      "From there we went to visit the building that had at one time been the synagogue in Sennfeld. Now\n",
      "it housed artifacts to show life at earlier times. Some of these artifacts showed evidence of the life of the\n",
      "Jews who had been forced to leave the area. Our guides also took us to Korb to see the house where my\n",

      "of it, I have heard my sisters talk of the small parlor that was off-limits to them. My oldest sister, Bertl,\n",

      "Our family was permanently separated in 1939 when my three sisters were sent to England on the\n",

      "go to the regular schools. In March 1939 they left for England without the opportunity to say goodbye\n",

      "take me.\n",
      "Soon after I arrived in Thorpe I came down with scarlet fever and had to be kept in quarantine as was\n",
      "the custom at that time. Alan was not allowed in the room where I was but played with me through the\n",
      "window. Once I had recuperated I became a devoted follower of Alan, who was nine at the time. I have\n",
      "been told he quickly accepted me into his life and allowed me to go places with him. While I immediately\n",
      "\n",
      "accepted Alan, it took me longer to get used to Uncle Harry (Mr. Harrison). I was somewhat uneasy\n",
      "around him. It wasnt clear what previous experiences I had had that led to this behavior.\n",
