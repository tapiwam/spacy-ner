      "Mistborn is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor Books. The first trilogy, published between 2006 and 2008, consists of The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. A second series was released between 2011 and 2022, and consists of the quartet The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning and The Lost Metal. Sanderson also released a novella in 2016, Mistborn: Secret History. Sanderson plans to write a third and fourth series.\n",
      "The first Mistborn trilogy chronicles the efforts of a secret group of Allomancers who attempt to overthrow a dystopian empire and establish themselves in a world covered by ash. The neologism Allomancer comes from two Greek words ἄλλος (allos) meaning otherly or different, and  μαντεία (manteía) meaning divination or sorcery, it indicates well the peculiar powers of this sect. The first trilogy was a huge success. This success pushed Sanderson to further develop his fictional universe, the Cosmere, which also includes The Stormlight Archive. Set about 300 years after the ending of the first trilogy, the second series is about the exploits of Waxillium Ladrian, a \"wild-west Deputy\" forced to move into the big city, and starts investigating kidnappings and robberies. The third series will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The main character is planned as a Terris woman who is a computer programmer and Nicroburst; her brother is also planned to be a character. The fourth series is planned to be a space-opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Development history ==\n",
      "Sanderson's first idea for Mistborn came while reading the Harry Potter series: He thought it would be interesting to set a story in a world where the \"dark lord\" triumphed and the \"prophesied hero\" failed. His second idea, originally unrelated, was to tell a heist story in a fantasy setting, an idea inspired by the Ocean's film series. The idea for the titular mist came while he was driving through mist in Idaho, which he combined with his memories of having once seen Washington National Cathedral lit from the inside. He originally developed feruchemy and allomancy for separate stories before deciding to bring them together in one story.Sanderson began work on Mistborn: The Final Empire while trying to get his earlier novel Elantris published. After writing two early iterations of Mistborn, he shifted his focus to his Stormlight Archive series, but chose to delay its publication in favor of completing the Mistborn series, which he thought would serve as a better follow-up to Elantris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Publication and future ===\n",
      "The original trilogy published by Sanderson was the first in what he used to call a \"trilogy of trilogies.\" Sanderson planned to publish multiple trilogies all set on the fictional planet Scadrial but in different eras: the second trilogy was to be set in an urban setting, featuring modern technology, and the third trilogy was to be a science fiction series, set in the far future. However, this structure changed with the release of The Alloy of Law, which began a new series set between the first trilogy and the planned second trilogy. After some confusion, Sanderson decided to refer to the overall series in terms of four eras, with Era One being the first trilogy, Era Two being the four books starting with The Alloy of Law, and Eras Three and Four being the other planned trilogies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Setting ==\n",
      "The series primarily takes place in a region on the planet of Scadrial. The events of Era One primarily take place in Classical Scadrial, specifically within the Final Empire, while Era Two and beyond take place in Post-Catacendre Scadrial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Prehistory ===\n",
      "The history of Scadrial started with Preservation and Ruin, two opposing gods who were Shards of Adonalsium, therefore fragments of the power of creation. Preservation's nature made him want to witness things that never ended, remaining unchanging and constant throughout infinity, whereas Ruin was d\n"

A second series, The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning, and The Lost Metal, was released between 2011 and 2022. Sanderson also released a novella in 2016, Mistborn: Secret History. The first Mistborn trilogy follows a secret group of Allomancers trying to overthrow a dystopian empire. The second series is set 300 years after the first trilogy and follows Waxillium Ladrian investigating kidnappings and robberies. The third series will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The fourth series is planned to be a space-opera. Sanderson's first idea for Mistborn was to set a story in a world where the \"dark lord\" triumphed and the \"prophesied hero\" failed. His second idea was to tell a heist story in a fantasy setting. The idea for the titular mist came to him while driving through mist in Idaho. Sanderson originally developed feruchemy and allomancy for separate stories before combining them in Mistborn. Sanderson began work on Mistborn: The Final Empire while trying to get his earlier novel Elantris published. Sanderson planned to publish multiple trilogies set on the fictional planet Scadrial but in different eras. The series primarily takes place in Classical Scadrial during Era One and in Post-Catacendre Scadrial during Era Two and beyond.
